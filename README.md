# Self-Balancing-Robot
Self Balancing Robot using Arduino UNO

## Description

The self-balancing machine resembles an inverted pendulum. This inverted pendulum is unable to maintain equilibrium on its own, unlike a conventional pendulum, which continues to swing after being prodded. It'll just topple over. So how can we strike a balance? A common illustration of balancing an inverted pendulum is to balance a broomstick on our index finger. Our finger is moved in the direction the stick is falling. A self-balancing robot does similarly, but it will tumble either forward or backward. We balance the robot by moving its wheels in the direction it is falling, same as how we balance a stick on our finger.


## Components

- Arduino Uno: The brain of the robot.
- MPU6050 (gyroscope and accelerometer): To detect the robot's orientation.
- Motor Driver Module (e.g., L298N): To control the motors.
- Two DC Motors: Drive the wheels for movement.
- Chassis with Wheels: Provides the physical structure for the robot.
- Battery or Power Source: To supply power.
- Jumper Wires: For wiring connections.
